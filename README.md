## Welcome to HabitUp! 🌱

### About HabitUp ⏱

HabitUp is a habit tracker, created with the one and only purpose of helping users create a new habit.</br>

Once in their dashboard, they can choose to create a New Task (habit) through filling in a form.</br>
The user journey starts in the main screen, where they can choose to see their tasks for the day or get inspired with quotes.</br>
The new task will automatically appear in their dashboard, where they can perform actions such as mark it as completed for the day, run a stopwatch set for the time goal, or manually enter the result in the counter.</br>
Clicking on a task redirects the user to a Task Details screen, where they can check out more details about their progress, such as streaks, and get a calendar view.</br>
